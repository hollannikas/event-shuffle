## Event Shuffle

> Eventshuffle is an application to help scheduling events with friends, quite like http://doodle.com/ but in a much simplified way. An event is created by posting a name and suitable dates to the backend, events can be queried from the backend and participants can submit dates suitable for them.

And this is a RESTful API, that enables that

### Running the server

A running version can be found on heroku at [https://event-shuffle.herokuapp.com](https://event-shuffle.herokuapp.com/api/v1/event/list)

If you have docker compose on your machine you can simply run `docker-compose up` and connect to port `8000`

Both versions (heroku and docker) use a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database

### API documentation

You can find the swagger documentation on heroku at [https://event-shuffle.herokuapp.com/documentation](https://event-shuffle.herokuapp.com/documentation).
The local swagger doc can of course be found on [http://localhost:8000/documentation](http://localhost:8000/documentation)

* Separate DB from model
